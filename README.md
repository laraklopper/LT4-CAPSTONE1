## HOW TO USE THE APPLICATION

## HOW TO RUN THE APPLICATION
Nodemon allows Node.js based applications by automatically restarting the node application when file changes in the directory are detected. Nodemon is installed as a dependency and allows the express back-end to run using npm start. The React front-end of the can be started in the terminal using npm start. The app can therefore be run using the npm start command in the terminal. To get the front-end and backend to work together the app uses a proxy server.
